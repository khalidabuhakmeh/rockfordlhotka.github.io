After 15+ years of self-hosting my blog with dasBlog I've decided to shift over to using GitHub and Jekyll for a more modern experience - primarily for you as a reader.

As an author I've been using [MarkdownMonster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com) and markdown to write and publish my content for the last 18-24 months. I imagine I'll continue with that approach, but now the content will flow through GitHub instead of direct-posting to dasBlog.

This does mean a new blog URL: https://blog.lhotka.net

The old http://lhotka.net/weblog will remain in place as an archive, at least for now. I suppose I'll eventually take it down, but I'm not in a hurry.

So friends, welcome to my new blog!
