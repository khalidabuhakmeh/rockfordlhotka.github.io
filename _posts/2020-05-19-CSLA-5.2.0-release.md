I am thrilled to announce that CSLA .NET version 5.2.0 is now available in NuGet.

The biggest news with this release is support for [Blazor WebAssembly 3.2.0](https://aka.ms/blazorwasmrelease), also released today!

Other highlights:

* Added `UseCsla` style initialization for WFP and Windows Forms
* New `CheckRulesAsync` method to wait for async rule completion
* New `LoadListMode` to simplify data portal operations that load collections
* Improved exception messages
* Numerous bug fixes

The [release notes doc](https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/blob/v5.2.0/releasenotes.md) contains a lot more detail.

For those who've already purchased the [Using CSLA: Blazor and WebAssembly](https://store.lhotka.net/using-csla-5-blazor-and-webassembly) book, I plan to have the updated version in the store for download this week. I have only one chapter left to finalize.
