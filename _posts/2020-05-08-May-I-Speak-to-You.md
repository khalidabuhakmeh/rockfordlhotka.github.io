We may not be able to travel, so I'm not flying to speaking events. But that doesn't mean speaking events have come to an end!

## CSLA .NET Ask Me Anything

On May 14 I am hosting an AMA event where you can enjoy discussion and Q&A around [CSLA .NET](https://cslanet.com) present and future.

This is exciting, because we're very close to the release of Microsoft [Blazor](https://blazor.net) WebAssembly, and the concurrent release of CSLA .NET 5.2.0 with support for that technology (plus much more).

## CTO Interview

This one won't be _available_ next week, but I'm also being interviewed next week regarding career development, my role as CTO at Magenic, and how I see the industry changing over time.

I'll let everyone know when this does come online.
